	<h2> Blog 1 </h2>
	<p> Learning HTML has been on my to do list for a few years now, first cropping up when I became aware of programming languages as a thing. Back then it wasn't really about HTML more about this new and interesting thing which had come into my world. Through a cipher cracking competition I became part of (and also recommendations from friends) Python2 became the language that I learnt. In the years that followed this moved onto python3, Linux, perl, lua, bash, ruby and a whole array of different tools. It is only now that I come back to HTML and it feels right. I wanted to get back into blogging again and rather than following my old path of setting up an easy blogger or wordpress I thought I'd throw myself in completely and learn HTML(5), CSS, PHP and Javascript to achieve my goal. For now I'm following the simple lessons on <a href="http://html.net">HTML.net</a> which have been brilliant.</p>
