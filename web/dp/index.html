		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>This is the home page of the <a href="https://github.com/democracy-project">Democracy Project</a>, a Linux themeing suite with a difference. A lot of similar projects often get criticized for not being open enough, and not listening to their users. This project is the opposite - everything we do is open source and no design decisions are made without a user vote. A theme suite by the people, for the people.</p>

		<p>At the minute it's just an <a href="https://github.com/democracy-project/icon-theme">icon theme</a>, but because of the open nature of the project we'll accept anything into our repos. There are a couple of dummy repos in there for starters. Similarly, anyone can contribute anything to any of the existing repos. All it has to do is pass the vote!</p>

		<p>To get involved with the project either as a contributor or voter simply check you're fine with <a href="https://github.com/Foggalong/scraps/blob/master/files/dp/constitution.md">constitution</a> and then <a href="mailto:joshua.h.fogg@gmail.com">send an email</a> with your Name and/or Alias and the subject line DP Register. As soon as you see your name on the <a href="https://github.com/Foggalong/scraps/blob/master/files/dp/voters.csv">voters list</a> you're good to go, and will receive your first email and ID token at the start of the next session.</p>

		<p><em>Note: the first session email will be sent out on July the 1st. You can <a href="vote">vote here</a> and see the <a href="results">results here</a>.</em></p>
