        <p>MUQC currently has two teams: the Manchester Manticores who are more competitive and the Manchester Minotaurs who are more casual. Having these two teams allows us to cater to a wider range of people.</p>

            <p>The Manticores are lead by Matthew Fenton, with assistance from Vice Captain Tua Karling. Fenton has played quidditch since October 2015 starting training regularly in the run up to BQC 2016. He became captain in February 2017 and of his time in the club, he had this to say:</p>

            <p><em>I was brought by a housemate and I enjoy the physical aspect of the sport and how the community is supportive and friendly. I also enjoy the company of my teammates at trainings and socials. In my role I organise the training sessions and the selection of the teams for tournaments. At tournaments I then try and motivate the team to play at their best.</em></p>

            <p>Since assuming the role he's lead the team from strength to strength, with recent achievements including #24 at British Quidditch Cup 2017, #11 at Northern Cup 2017, and #3 at Cottonopolis III.</p>

            <p>The Minotaurs are our new second team and are lead by Imogen Asquith. Asquith has played Quidditch since September 2016 primarily as a Chaser, becoming captain in October 2017 when the new teams was created. She's successfully worked with other experienced players to foster the talent in our new players and create a solid foundation on what to build the teams future.</p>

            <p>Asquith lead the team through a difficult first tournament, going up against some formidable opponents. At the end of Northern Cup 2017 the Minotaurs came #23, winning local rival Sheffield Sealions who placed #25.</p>

        <p>One of the driving factors behind the clubs recent success has been our amazing coaching staff.</p>

        <div style="float:left; padding-bottom:20px;">
            <div class="name">
                <a id="beater" class="anchor" href="#beater" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octiconocticon-link"></span></a>Beater Coach<em> - Sam Davies</em></h3>
            </div>
            <img src="./images/beater.png" alt="photo of beater coach" id="profile">
            <p>Sam is simply a god and is loved by all in his benevolence. Holding the position of being the only Manchester player to have won Manchester’s own Cottonopolis tournament, Sam has the power to chose life or death for all the clubs beaters. Specialising in his own form of personal defensive beating, Sam proudly boasts that Manchester has the best beater duellists in the UK.</p>

            <p>Starting playing in 2012, Sam has one of the longest playing records in UK quidditch and in his time has played for five official competitive teams (Bangor Broken Broomsticks, Team UK, Chester Centurions, Velociraptors QC and Manchester Manticores) As well as playing on 6 different Mercenary teams and 1 inactive training team.</p>

            <p>In 2014, Sam was selected to play for Team UK and used for his unique style of beating to directly contest opposing beaters, being noted for skill at defending his team’s seeker and the snitch from the opposing national teams. Nowadays, Sam prefers his time off pitch watching and aiding his team’s beaters grow and advance. Sam Left The Velociraptors QC during their successful run to being UK champions, to join Manchester quidditch club, sighting Manchester’s social and pub orientated gatherings as a leading cause for the change.</p>

            <p>Sam’s proudest quidditch moment was captioning Bangor to win gold at the Whitenight’s tournament in Redding, as well as holding the title of Northern Champion twice, having won the Northern Cup twice on two separate teams. Sam has also obtained medals at the British Quidditch Cup, Valentines Cup, Costume Cup and Mercian Cup. He was also awarded Full colours and Blues by the University of Bangor for his efforts in expanding the sport locally and preforming on a national team, respectively. He’s looking forward to adding some Manchester medals to his collection.</p>
