		<h1>Web Work</h1>
        <p>This website hosts a collection of web projects I've worked on; the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>

        <h2>Ongoing</h2>
        <p>These are projects I still tinker with, they may be spun off into separate repos later.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/map/index.html">Where I've Been</a></h3>
        <p>Map which uses SVG-CSS integration to show labels on hover. It pulls precisely zero clever tricks to achieve this effect, all done with explicit labelling. Would like to make it smarter in future.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/os/index.html">OS Timeline</a></h3>
        <p>An in-progress idea to create timelines from JSON files to be rendered as HTML. There are some existing packages which can do this but most are premium and/or not open source.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/socs/index.html">Society Timeline</a></h3>
        <p>Another website timeline project, this one being used for my undergrad uni society membership. The stylesheet for this one was much nicer but I never got around to making a generator.</p>

        <h2>Archive</h2>
        <p>These are projects are here for posterity and won't be updated.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/dp/index.html">Democracy Project</a></h3>
        <p>Back in summer 2014 I had an idea to have an icon theme whereby all changes were voted on. There was some initial interest but it quickly fizzled out.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/time/index.html">Timezone Tracker</a></h3>
        <p>Back when <a href="numixproject.github.io">Numix</a> was a big team which worked (on occasion) synchronously, we used this page to keep track of what time it was where everyone was. It simply uses <a href="www.timeanddate.com">timeanddate.com</a> iframes.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/first/index.html">First Website</a></h3>
        <p>Used from January to March 2014, the first website I ever made. It was hosted on a weird free unix server I found online.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/second/index.html">Second Website</a></h3>
        <p>Used from March to October 2014. My first foray into using CSS to make things look not-totally-pants.</p>

        <h3><a href="web/third/index.html">Third version of my website</a></h3>
        <p>Used from October 2014 to December 2015. Last version of my website written in <a href="https://github.com/Foggalong/Wren">Wren</a> before I switched to <a href=https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>. CSS is still a little bit clunky and basic but improved.</p>
